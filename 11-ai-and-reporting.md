### AI Limitations

It's important to understand what EvrMind AI cannot do:

- **Session Message Limit**: Maximum of **10 messages per chat session**
  - After 10 messages, you'll need to close and reopen the chat to start a new session

  - May not provide accurate information about unrelated topics
  - Not a general-purpose AI assistant
  
- **No Actions on Your Behalf**: Cannot perform actions like:
  - Creating posts or uploading content
  - Sending messages to other users
  - Modifying your profile settings
  - These actions require your direct interaction with the app
  
- **Text-Only Communication**: Currently supports text-based conversations only
  - No image analysis or file processing in chat
  - Cannot process screenshots or media files
  
- **No Real-Time Account Data**: Limited access to your personal data

### Conversation Management

**Message Display**:

- Your previous session is closed and history is cleared
- A fresh session begins with empty chat and message counter reset

**Message Persistence**:
- Conversations are session-specific and not permanently saved
- If you close and reopen the app, the conversation resets
- This ensures privacy and reduces storage usage

### Error Handling

If something goes wrong during your chat:

1. **Error Dialog Appears**: An alert dialog titled "Something went wrong" is displayed
2. **Error Details**: The specific error message is shown (e.g., network timeout, API error)
3. **Dismiss Error**: Tap the "OK" button to close the dialog
4. **Retry**: You can send your message again or try a different question

**Common Causes**:
- Network connectivity issues (no internet or poor signal)
- API rate limits (too many requests in a short time)
- Temporary service unavailability
- Device memory constraints

### Best Practices for Using AI Chat

To get the most out of EvrMind AI:

1. **Be Specific**: Ask detailed, focused questions rather than vague ones
   - Good: "How do I add a cover photo to my profile?"
   - Avoid: "How do profile work?"

2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant details when asking about issues
   - Example: "I'm trying to create a community but I'm getting an error message"

3. **Break Down Complex Questions**: Divide complicated topics into smaller questions
   - Instead of asking about all profile settings at once, ask about one feature at a time

4. **Use Follow-Up Questions**: Refine previous answers by asking clarifying questions
   - Example: "Can you give me more details on that?", "What about X part?"

5. **Manage Session Limit**: Keep track of your message count
   - Plan questions before reaching the 10-message limit
   - Start a new session when needed

6. **Report Issues**: If the AI gives incorrect or inappropriate responses
   - Contact Whatsevr support with details about the problematic response
   - Help us improve the AI by reporting inaccuracies

### Troubleshooting AI Chat Issues

**Problem: AI is not responding**
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection, wait a moment, and try again. If the problem persists, close and reopen the app.

**Problem: Error messages appear when trying to send messages**
- **Solution**: Note the error details shown in the dialog. Common causes include network issues or service unavailability. Try again in a few moments. If errors continue, contact support.

**Problem: Responses are slow or taking too long**
- **Solution**: AI processing typically takes 2-5 seconds. Be patient and wait for the response. If consistently taking longer, check your internet connection.

**Problem: Reached the 10-message limit**
- **Solution**: Close the AI chat page and reopen it to start a new session with 10 fresh messages available.

**Problem: AI responses don't seem accurate**
- **Solution**: Rephrase your question more clearly or provide additional context. Try breaking complex questions into simpler parts.

**Problem: Can't find the AI chat feature**
- **Solution**: Check your app menu or dashboard for the "EvrMind Ai" option. If not visible, ensure your app is updated to the latest version.

### Responsible Reporting Guidelines

To maintain the integrity of the reporting system and help keep Whatsevr safe:

**Be Honest**
- Only report genuine violations of community guidelines
- False reports waste valuable moderation resources
- Repeated false reports may result in reporting privileges being restricted

**Be Specific**
- Provide clear, detailed descriptions when possible
- Include timestamps if relevant (e.g., "posted today at 3 PM")
- Quote or reference the specific problematic content
- This helps moderators act quickly and accurately

**Choose Correct Category**
- Select the most appropriate report category
- Helps route your report to the right team
- Improves response time and accuracy
- Review all category descriptions before choosing

**Don't Abuse the System**
- Reporting is not for minor disagreements or personal feuds
- Use reporting for genuine community guideline violations
- Abusive use of reporting may result in restricted reporting privileges

**Consider Alternatives First**
- For minor annoyances, consider blocking or muting instead
- Blocking prevents you from seeing content from that user
- Muting temporarily hides content without blocking interaction

**Report Serious Issues**
- Always report content that:
  - Threatens safety or physical harm
  - Promotes violence
  - Involves illegal activity
  - Contains exploitation or abuse
  - These issues require immediate attention

**One Report is Enough**
- Submit one report per violation
- Don't submit duplicate reports for the same item
- Multiple reports don't speed up the process
- Report once and let moderators handle it

### When to Report vs. Other Actions

Use this guidance to determine the best action:

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|
| **Report** | Community guideline violations, illegal content, harassment, spam, scams, misinformation, violence |
| **Block** | Users you don't want to interact with (but aren't violating guidelines); blocks prevent them from messaging or viewing your profile |
| **Mute** | Temporarily hide content from users you're not interested in (less severe than blocking) |
| **Unfollow** | Stop seeing content from users or communities you're no longer interested in |
| **Leave Community** | Exit communities that don't align with your interests or values |

### Troubleshooting Reporting Issues

**Problem: Cannot submit a report**
- **Solution**: Ensure you have selected a category from the dropdown. Check your internet connection. Try submitting again.

**Problem: Report button is not visible or missing**
- **Solution**: Some content may not be reportable (e.g., your own posts, deleted content). Verify you're accessing the correct menu. If an issue persists, contact support.

**Problem: Previous Reports section is not loading**
- **Solution**: Try pulling down to refresh the page. Check your internet connection. Restart the app if needed.

**Problem: Report status is not updating**
- **Solution**: Reports can take time to review (24-72 hours typical). Check back later. Status updates may not be immediate. Pull to refresh the page.

**Problem: Disagree with report outcome**
- **Solution**: If you believe a report was incorrectly dismissed, you can submit a new report with additional details or evidence. Contact Whatsevr support for appeals or further assistance.

**Problem: Cannot access previous reports**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in to the correct account. Previous reports are account-specific. Try scrolling down to the "Previous Reports" section.
