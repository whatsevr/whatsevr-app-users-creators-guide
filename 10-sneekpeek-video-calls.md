## Tips for Better Matching

- **Peak Hours**: Evenings (6 PM - 11 PM) and weekends have more users
- **Off-Peak Hours**: Mid-day and early mornings may have fewer users
- **Best for Fast Matching**: Friday-Sunday evenings typically fastest
- **Plan Accordingly**: Use peak hours when you want quicker matches

- **Increases Likelihood**: More complete = higher chance of good matches
- **Fresh Content**: Update bio occasionally to stay interesting
- **Quality Picture**: Clear, friendly profile photo improves matching

### Preference Settings

- **Broader is Better**: "All Days" and "Audio & Video" get more matches
- **Restrictive Preferences**: Narrow down after trying different calls
- **Balance**: Find sweet spot between specific preferences and match frequency

### Connection Quality

- **Use WiFi**: More stable than cellular data
- **Minimize Interference**: Close other apps using network
- **Check Signal**: Ensure strong signal strength

- **Keep Updated**: Update app to latest version for best experience
- **Device Storage**: Ensure adequate free space
- **Permissions**: Verify camera, microphone, storage permissions enabled
- **Restart When Needed**: Restart app or device if experiencing issues

### Patience and Expectations

- **Give it Time**: Sometimes matching takes longer, that's normal

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Sneekpeek free to use?

Yes! Random video calling is completely free for all Whatsevr users. No subscription or charges required.

### Can I choose who I match with?

No, the whole point of Sneekpeek is the random matching experience! This creates authentic, unpredictable connections. However, your preferences (availability, call type) help filter compatible matches.

### How long do calls last?

Calls have a time limit:
- **Production Version**: 2 minutes per call
- **Debug/Testing Version**: 10 seconds per call
- After the limit, you automatically return to the matching queue
- You can end any call earlier by tapping Leave

### Can I skip to the next person?

Yes! Tap the **Leave Call** button anytime to end the call and move to the next match. No need to wait for the time limit.

### Will my main Whatsevr friends see my Sneekpeek activity?

No, absolutely not. Sneekpeek is completely separate from your main account. Your friends won't see any Sneekpeek activity, and Sneekpeek activity won't appear on your main profile.

### Can I block someone?

If someone behaves inappropriately, use the reporting system to report them. This alerts platform moderation to review the user's behavior. The platform can take action against violators.

### What if I don't want to use video?

No problem! In your profile settings:
1. Edit your profile
2. Go to extended profile section
3. Change **Call Type Preference** to "Audio Call"
4. Save changes

Now you'll only match with other audio-call users.

### Can I use Sneekpeek on multiple devices?

Yes, you can access Sneekpeek from multiple devices, but only one active matching session can run at a time. If you start matching on one device, you'll need to exit before matching on another device.

### What happens if my internet disconnects during a call?

Your call will end immediately. When you reconnect:
- Return to the matching screen automatically
- Can rejoin the queue and match with someone new
- Your previous call data is lost (normal behavior)

### How does the 5-second cooldown after calls work?

After each call ends:
1. System ends the video connection
2. 5-second cooldown runs in the background (invisible to you)
3. You see "Finding someone..." screen during this time
4. System automatically rejoins you to the matching queue
5. Next match happens seamlessly

It's built-in to prevent issues and ensure quality matches.

2. Tap the report/flag icon
3. Select the reason (harassment, abuse, inappropriate content, etc.)
4. Add details about what happened
5. Submit the report
