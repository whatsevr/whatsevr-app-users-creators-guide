# Profile & Account Management

## Introduction

Your profile is your identity in Whatsevr. It's where you share who you are, what you do, and what you're passionate about. Whether you're a regular user looking to connect with friends or a professional showcasing your services, Whatsevr provides comprehensive tools to customize your profile and manage your account.

A complete and well-maintained profile increases your visibility and helps other users discover you more easily. It also enables features like portfolio showcasing and professional networking.

Whatsevr supports two types of accounts:

Regularly review your active sessions to ensure only authorized devices have access to your account. If you see sessions from devices you don't recognize or don't use anymore:

1. Log them out immediately
2. This prevents unauthorized access even if someone has your password
3. Unknown sessions may indicate a compromised password - consider changing it

- After uploading or downloading lots of media

### Important Note
