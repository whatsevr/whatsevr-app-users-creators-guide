## 8. Understanding Content Recommendations

### How the Recommendation Algorithm Works

Whatsevr's recommendation system learns from your activity to provide increasingly personalized content. The algorithm considers:

- **Your Follows**: Content from creators and communities you follow
- **Your Interactions**: Posts you've reacted to, commented on, or shared
- **Your Interests**: Content types and topics you engage with most
- **Your History**: Your viewing patterns and activity timeline
- **Trending Content**: Popular posts gaining momentum on the platform

### Personalized vs. Public Recommendations

**Home Feed (Personalized):**
- Shows content based specifically on your activity and follows
- Tailored to your interests and preferences
- More relevant and customized as you use the app

**Explore Page (Public):**
- Shows trending and popular content from all users
- Not filtered by your follows or activity
- Great for discovering new creators and trends outside your current interests

### How Engagement Affects Recommendations

The more you engage with content, the better the algorithm understands your preferences:

- **Reactions**: Show the algorithm what content resonates with you
- **Comments**: Indicate strong interest in specific topics
- **Shares**: Signal that you find content valuable enough to share
- **Follows**: Help the algorithm identify creators relevant to you
- **Views**: Indicate interest in certain content types (videos, photos, etc.)
- **Saves**: Show content you want to return to later

### Privacy Considerations

- Your activity is tracked to personalize recommendations
- You have control over your saved content and activity history
- Review your Activity History anytime to see what's being tracked
- Activity tracking can typically be controlled through account settings (check Profile & Account Management documentation)

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Content Not Loading

**Problem**: Posts, videos, or content don't appear in feeds.

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you have stable WiFi or cellular data
   - Move closer to your WiFi router if signal is weak

2. Pull-to-refresh to reload content
   - Swipe down on any feed to manually refresh

3. Clear app cache
   - Go to device Settings → Apps → Whatsevr → Storage → Clear Cache
   - This removes temporary files without losing your data

4. Restart the app
   - Close Whatsevr completely
   - Wait a few seconds
   - Reopen the app

5. Verify you're logged in
   - Ensure you're signed into your Whatsevr account
   - Log out and back in if needed

### Search Not Working

**Problem**: Search results don't appear or search returns no results.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure search query meets minimum length
   - Your search must be at least 4 characters
   - Example: "photo" (5 chars) ✓, "abc" (3 chars) ✗

2. Check internet connection
   - Search requires an active internet connection

3. Try different search terms
   - More specific searches often yield better results
   - Try variations of your search word

4. Switch between content type tabs
   - Try searching in different tabs to find results
   - "All People" tab searches across all content types

5. Restart the app if search is unresponsive
   - Close and reopen Whatsevr

### Flicks Videos Not Playing

**Problem**: Videos in the Flicks feed don't play or buffer frequently.

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
   - Flicks videos require a stable, preferably high-speed connection
   - Switch from cellular to WiFi if possible

2. Verify device is not muted
   - Check if your device is in silent mode
   - If so, toggle the mute switch to hear audio

3. Try the app's mute/unmute button
   - Tap the speaker icon in the bottom-right corner
   - Toggle between muted and unmuted

4. Close and reopen the Flicks feed
   - Navigate away from Flicks
   - Return to the Flicks feed to restart playback

6. Check device storage
   - Low storage can affect video playback performance
   - Delete unused apps or files to free up space

### Recommendations Not Personalized

**Problem**: Your For You feed doesn't seem personalized, or you see mostly unrelated content.

**Solutions:**
1. Engage more with content
   - React to posts you like
   - Comment on content that interests you
   - Share posts with others
   - This trains the algorithm to understand your preferences

3. Review your Activity History
   - Check if interactions are being tracked
   - Ensure you're actively engaging with content

4. Give the algorithm time
   - Recommendations improve over time as you use the app
   - If you're new to Whatsevr, check back after a week of active use

5. Verify you're viewing the correct tab
   - Ensure you're in the "For You" tab (not the "Explore" tab)
   - Explore shows public content, not personalized content

### Activity History Not Showing

**Problem**: Your Activity History is empty or not updating.

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
   - Activity History requires an active connection to load

2. Pull-to-refresh the Activity History tab
   - Swipe down on the Activity History tab to refresh

3. Verify you've interacted with content
   - Activity History shows your interactions
   - If you haven't engaged with content, history may appear empty

   - (See Profile & Account Management documentation for details)

5. Restart the app
   - Close and reopen Whatsevr to refresh the activity display

### Infinite Scroll Not Loading More Content

**Problem**: When scrolling to the bottom of a feed, no new content loads.

**Solutions:**
1. Scroll to the very bottom of the feed
   - Continue scrolling until you see a loading indicator
   - Don't stop in the middle of the feed

2. Wait a few seconds for content to load
   - Don't immediately scroll further while content is loading
   - Allow time for the server to respond

3. Check internet connection
   - Infinite scroll requires continuous internet connection
   - Ensure you have stable connectivity

4. Pull-to-refresh to reset the feed
   - Swipe down to refresh
